# The Fucket List

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) that uses Supabase on the BE to manage a Postgres DB and user auth. This is a list application which allows users to create a 'Fucket List', a list of stretch goals for life that they wish to achieve but don't think they'll be able to easily.

The app is hosted on Vercel [here](https://fucket-list.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
