        <p>
          The Fucket List is a website where you can list, track and share all
          your stretch goals in life - things you want to do, but they scare
          you, things you think you may not be able to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is built upon the 'Fuck It List' concept that was created
          by Jesse Itzler
